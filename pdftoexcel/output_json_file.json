As long as the contact between fuel and Greentech  Molecule Enhancer was \nestablished, the molecule enhancer can change the aggregation of molecules from larger molecule clusters to a \nsmaller ones or even single molecule by breaking the Van der Waals force between the fuel molecules. Moreover, \nthe Greentech  Air Refining Device can purify the air and increase the oxygen level in the air by neutralizing the \npollutant floating in the air such as dust, emissions, germs, pollen, tobacco smoke, moulds and all other species \nposses' positive ions. The improvement of fuel and air can achieve the better combustion reaction to generate \nmore horsepower and torque.  \nREDUCES FUEL CONSUMPTION  : According to the lab research from Taipei Medical University, the surface \ntension of the fuel was decreased by contacted with Greentech  Molecule Enhancer; causing the smaller droplets \nof the fuel after it was ejected from the nozzle. The smaller droplets, exposing larger surface area in the air, \ncontact with oxygen for better combustion reaction, and hence, better fuel efficiency.\nMINIMIZE EXHAUST EMISSIONS  : The large molecule clusters of the fuel always cause the incomplete \ncombustion and produce emissions such as carbon monoxide (CO), non -methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), \nhydrocarbons (HC), and nitrogen oxides ( NOx). The Greentech  Molecule Enhancer can change the aggregation \nof fuel molecules from large clusters to a single molecule by breaking the Van der Waals force between the fuel \nmolecules. The smaller molecule clusters of the fuel can then achieve the complete combustion to reduce the \nexhaust emissions.\nENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY  : Since 2000,  we have  been devoted to create the energy saving products \nand environmental friendly products. All the Greentech  product materials are environmental friendly and \nconformed to the RoHS  standard. By using Greentech  Fuel Saving Device, not only can it reduce the fuel \nconsumption, but also lower the exhaust emissions.\nLASTS FOR 10 YEARS  : \nGreentech  Fuel Saving Device \napplies our patented Molecule \nEnhance Technology which takes \nadvantage of physical phenomenon \ninstead of chemical reaction; \ntherefore, there is no chemical \nreaction and catalyst involved.\nNone of the materials used will be \nconsumed during the process.\nBecause of the physical natural, \nmany research reports suggest, our \npatented technology can last for a \nvery long time, more than 10 years \nat least.\n=== Page 102 ===\nDetailed Product Description :\n1) GSM SIM back -up tool. \n2) Easy to read the phonebook of SIM card and save to PC. \n3) Can write the phonebook saved in the PC to another new SIM card . \n4) Read, edit, backup telephone directory and SMS. \n5) Leisurely create, edit, backup mobile ring tones and pictures (only for nokia phone). \n6) Suitable for those who have several SIM cards to backup and modify information. \n7) Information safekeeping, set, cancel, manage mobile PIN password. \n8) Supporting USB2.0 to read and write quickly. \n9) Beautiful contour, no extra power, plug and play USB port. \n10) System requirements: Windows 98, ME, 2000, XP.",

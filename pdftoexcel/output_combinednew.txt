UV30 CCTV cameras, UHF, RFID, VHF Jammer
UV30 is a UHF VHF jammer that is used as the desktop solution for 
protection against low frequencies and wireless threats related to them. 
Among the threats it can prevent you will find CCTV cameras watching 
you every day on the streets of the city you live in, RFID chips which are 
placed into more and more devices these days, NFC technology that is 
embedded not only in many of our smartphones but also into lots of smart 
home systems along with RFID chips and remote control technologies.
Low frequencies are also used by many communication devices like two -
way radios, walkie -talkies and similar ones. These communication devices 
either can be eavesdropped or might impose threat by just working in the 
inappropriate time and place. UV30 is the right kind of device to be used 
against all those low frequencies and possible dangers due to their usage. 
It is a stationary device that can help you to protect any building from low 
frequencies, NFC signals and LoJack  tracking as well.

Installation Approaches: Fix up outdoor antenna reception on 
housetop and point to signal tower. Connect outdoor antenna to 
''outdoor'' port in repeater machine through cable. Connect indoor 
antenna to ''indoor'' port in repeater machine through cable also. Plug 
Technique Supporting: If still no signal receipt after activated 
repeater, please check if outdoor antenna point to signal tower or 
elsewhere have strong signal and check if strength achieve. Please 
adjust the direction of outdoor antenna if it cannot call out. If strength is 
not steady, please check if outdoor and indoor antenna are too close. 
Please ensure the outdoor and indoor antenna have distance of 20 
meters at least ,with a wall between and net a same horizontal line. 
NOTE: The distance between the outdoor antenna and the amplifier 
is not more than 30 meters. The outdoor Antenna not close to a large 
antenna, high -voltage lines, transformers, or metal mesh, etc. The 
distance between the indoor antenna and the amplifier is not more than 
40 meters. The indoor antennas do not close to the wall as far as 
possible in order to increase the coverage area. The indoor antenna 
and the outdoor antenna are advised to stay away from each other for 
more than one floor distance to prevent cyclic signal amplification. If 
lack of communication quality, please change the installation position 
of the outdoor antenna and adjustment the indicate direction of 
antenna. It is best to enclose waterproof tape at the junction, and 
prevent moisture narrow the indoor signal coverage area. Try to 
straight the cable, do not bend more than 90 degree.

030 –Car Fuel Saver
TECHNOLOGY AT IT’S BEST !!!
SPECIFICATIONS:  ENHANCES HORSE POWER : G11 Fuel Saving Device includes Molecule 
Enhancer and Air Refining Device. As long as the contact between fuel and Greentech  Molecule Enhancer was 
established, the molecule enhancer can change the aggregation of molecules from larger molecule clusters to a 
smaller ones or even single molecule by breaking the Van der Waals force between the fuel molecules. Moreover, 
the Greentech  Air Refining Device can purify the air and increase the oxygen level in the air by neutralizing the 
pollutant floating in the air such as dust, emissions, germs, pollen, tobacco smoke, moulds and all other species 
posses' positive ions. The improvement of fuel and air can achieve the better combustion reaction to generate 
more horsepower and torque.  
REDUCES FUEL CONSUMPTION  : According to the lab research from Taipei Medical University, the surface 
tension of the fuel was decreased by contacted with Greentech  Molecule Enhancer; causing the smaller droplets 
of the fuel after it was ejected from the nozzle. The smaller droplets, exposing larger surface area in the air, 
contact with oxygen for better combustion reaction, and hence, better fuel efficiency.
MINIMIZE EXHAUST EMISSIONS  : The large molecule clusters of the fuel always cause the incomplete 
combustion and produce emissions such as carbon monoxide (CO), non -methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), 
hydrocarbons (HC), and nitrogen oxides ( NOx). The Greentech  Molecule Enhancer can change the aggregation 
of fuel molecules from large clusters to a single molecule by breaking the Van der Waals force between the fuel 
molecules. The smaller molecule clusters of the fuel can then achieve the complete combustion to reduce the 
exhaust emissions.
ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY  : Since 2000,  we have  been devoted to create the energy saving products 
and environmental friendly products. All the Greentech  product materials are environmental friendly and 
conformed to the RoHS  standard. By using Greentech  Fuel Saving Device, not only can it reduce the fuel 
consumption, but also lower the exhaust emissions.
LASTS FOR 10 YEARS  : 
Greentech  Fuel Saving Device 
applies our patented Molecule 
Enhance Technology which takes 
advantage of physical phenomenon 
instead of chemical reaction; 
therefore, there is no chemical 
reaction and catalyst involved.
None of the materials used will be 
consumed during the process.
Because of the physical natural, 
many research reports suggest, our 
patented technology can last for a 
very long time, more than 10 years 
at least.
